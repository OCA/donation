=============
Donation Base
=============

This is the base module for donations. This module doesn't do anything in itself ; it just adds some properties on products and partners and adds the *donation.tax.receipt* object.

To get some real features, you should install the *donation* or the *donation_sale* module. To understand the difference between these 2 modules, read `this post <https://github.com/OCA/donation/issues/22>`_.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

 * create donation products
 * set the *Tax Receipt Option* on partners
