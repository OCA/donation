The Donation Recurrency module enhances the functionality of donation recurrence management within the system.
It introduces a template for defining donation recurrence patterns, automating the execution of pending donations via a cron job.
Additionally, users have the option to execute pending donations in bulk. 
All donations created through this module are initially set to the draft state.
Furthermore, there's a relationship established between donation recurrence and donations, 
allowing users to easily query donations associated with a specific recurrence pattern.
