Usage

To use this module:

* On line basis, add a already configured in-kind donation (consumable/stockable) or create a new one.
* Select the desired warehouse for the inbound and confirm the donation.
* A stock move from the location donor to the selected inbound location will be generated and
  you will have an receipt in the warehouse.

  and the administrative part can be created with a button
