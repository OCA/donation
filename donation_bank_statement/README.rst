This module is designed to handle donation received by credit transfer.
After the import of the bank statement, you can start a wizard that will
create a donation for each unreconciled bank statement lines affected to
a particular account.

Configuration
=============

To configure the module, you have to create a bank journal dedicated
to donations via credit transfer, that will have a special transfer
account as default debit/credit account.

Then, in the menu *Accounting > Configuration > Settings*, in the
section *Donations*, you must select this journal as the *Donations via
Credit Transfer Journal*. You must also select the donation product that
will be used by default on donation generated from bank statements.

Usage
=====

To use the module, you should import your bank statement as usual.
During the reconciliation step, when you have a donation by credit
transfer, you should set the account that you used as default
debit/credit account on the journal dedicated for donations via credit
transfer. When you validate the bank statement, Odoo will create draft
donations linked to the related bank statement line. When these draft
donations are validated, it will create the corresponding account move
and reconcile it with the account move of the bank statement.

Hint: for a faster processing of the bank statement, you can create a *Reconciliation Model* dedicated to the Donations via Credit Transfer in the menu *Accounting > Dashboard > Bank Journal > More > Reconciliation Models*. This reconciliation model must be configured with the account corresponding to the donations via credit transfer.
