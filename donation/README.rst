This module handles donations by cash, check or by credit transfer and generate the corresponding journal entries and tax receipts. To fully support donations by credit transfer, if you are using the OCA bank statement reconcile interface, you also need the module **donation_bank_statement_oca**.

This module will assist you in writing a thanks letter.

This module also supports in-kind donations (in-kind donations don't generate any accounting entry but can generate a tax receipt).

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

 * create donation products
 * make sure you have an inbound payment mode for each payment mode used to receive donations. This payment mode must be configured with *Link to Bank Account* set to *Fixed* and with the donation option active.
 * if you wish to have a control amount on the donation, add the users to the group *Donation Check Total*

If you receive donations via credit transfer, you must also:

* in the configuration page *Invoicing > Configuration > Settings*, in the *Donations* section, select the product that will be used for donations by credit transfer.
* on the bank journals corresponding to the bank accounts on which you receive donations by credit transfer, in the *Payments Configuration* tab, select the *Donation by credit transfer account*. This account must allow reconciliation.
* Make sure that the accountant that processes bank statements has *User* access level or higher on the *Donation* application.

Usage
=====

This module handles donations by cash, check or by credit transfer:

* for donation by cash or check, you should first create a new donation and validate it. Then, if you have the module *account_check_deposit* from the project `OCA/account-financial-tools <https://github.com/OCA/account-financial-tools>`_, you can create a check deposit.
* for a donation by credit transfer, the process is different: import your bank statement file and, while processing it, you will see a donation button that allow you to create a new donation directly from the bank statement reconcile interface.

When you validate a donation:

* it will create a journal entry that goes directly from the revenue account to the payment account without going through a receivable account.
* if the tax receipt option of the donor is configured as *For Each Donation* and the product of the donation line is eligible to a tax receipt, it will generate the tax receipt.

To have some statistics about the donations, go to the menu Donation > Reporting > Donations Analysis.
