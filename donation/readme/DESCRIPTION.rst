This module handles donations by cash, check or by credit transfer and generate the corresponding journal entries and tax receipts. To fully support donations by credit transfer, if you are using the OCA bank statement reconcile interface, you also need the module **donation_bank_statement_oca**.

This module will assist you in writing a thanks letter.

This module also supports in-kind donations (in-kind donations don't generate any accounting entry but can generate a tax receipt).
