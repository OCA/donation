This module handles donations by cash, check or by credit transfer and generate the corresponding journal entries and tax receipts. Before Odoo v14, support for donations by credit transfer was added by a separate module *donation_bank_statement*.

This module will assist you in writing a thanks letter (before Odoo v14, this feature was added by a separate module *donation_thanks*).

This module also supports in-kind donations (in-kind donations don't generate any accounting entry but can generate a tax receipt).
