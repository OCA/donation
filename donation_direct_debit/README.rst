With this module, when you validate a donation that has a payment method linked to a SEPA direct debit payment mode:

* if a draft direct debit order for SEPA direct debit already exists, a new payment line linked to the donation is added to it,

* otherwise, a new SEPA direct debit order is created and a payment line linked to the donation is added to it.

A message is added in the chatter of the donation with a link to the payment order.

Configuration
=============

In the menu *Invoicing > Configuration > Management > Payment Modes*, make sure that you have a payment mode for SEPA Direct Debit that has the donation option active.

Usage
=====

On the donor (i.e. partner) form, create a bank account (IBAN) and create a related mandate. Validate the mandate.

Create a new donation for that donor. Select the SEPA direct debit payment mode: a new required field *Mandate* will appear: select the mandate of the donor. Create the donation line(s).

Validate the donation. In the chatter of the donation, you will see a message about the debit order that has been created or updated with a link to it. You can then click on the link and finalize the debit order.
