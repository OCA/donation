With this module, when you validate a donation that has a payment method linked to a SEPA direct debit payment mode:

* if a draft direct debit order for SEPA direct debit already exists, a new payment line linked to the donation is added to it,

* otherwise, a new SEPA direct debit order is created and a payment line linked to the donation is added to it.

A message is added in the chatter of the donation with a link to the payment order.
