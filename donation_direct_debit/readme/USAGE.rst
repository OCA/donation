On the donor (i.e. partner) form, create a bank account (IBAN) and create a related mandate. Validate the mandate.

Create a new donation for that donor. Select the SEPA direct debit payment mode: a new required field *Mandate* will appear: select the mandate of the donor. Create the donation line(s).

Validate the donation. In the chatter of the donation, you will see a message about the debit order that has been created or updated with a link to it. You can then click on the link and finalize the debit order.
